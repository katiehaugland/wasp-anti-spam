A unique anti-spam solution to help you fight spam in registration, comments, forms (Contact Form 7).

== Description ==

= PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN IF YOU DON'T HAVE REGULAR SITE BACKUP, THIS IS STABLE BUT THE FIRST RELEASE. =

A unique anti-spam solution to help you fight spam in registration, comments, forms (Contact Form 7).
When the user comment or using contact form 7 his comments or message will not sent or be visible until
the user will press a unique link sent to him when he submited his message.

= For Example: =
Think like this i'm a spammer registering to your site, after register to your site i see a message about
the need to activate my account, if i used fake email address this address will be blocked because it's never
activated, if i used a real address i activated my account with success !
Now i would like to change my email address so i can spam without getting any messages from your site but oops
i can't change my email address because the plugin blocking it !
Ok let's try my luck and start spam in the commnets, posting my first comment and getting a message: 
"to see the comment you must approve your comment by pressing the link in your email address".

I think you got the idea but what would happen if i will not press it the email and the ip address will be blocked because no one press the link, if i did press the link in the second on the third time YOU as site admin can block
his ip and email address manually in the plugin options.
